In order to increase the code test coverage, the white box test method is adopted.
By analyzing the functions in the parser class, analyze the functions or codes that have not been tested one by one,
formulate a test plan, and finally improve the code test coverage.
For example, the replace function has several conditions.It can be replaced by regular expressions and by matching key strings,
so as to improve the code coverage.
