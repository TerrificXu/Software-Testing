Cover three sub functions with one test case
Three separate use cases are used to cover three sub functions respectively
The coverage boundary of test cases is more clearly defined, the test results are more directional to product problems,
the coupling degree between test cases is the lowest,
and the interference between them is less.
Each test case should be as simple as possible, and only verify the content you want to verify
